# DragAndDropView
Drag and drop feature implemented on Recycler View. Long press on a list item and drag it to move and place it anywhere over the list. Reorder or prioritize the list as required. Just copy paste the interfaces and implement the Callbacks in Adapter and ViewHolder. Please refer the above demo.
